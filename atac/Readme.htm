<p>This TCL extension is not (yet) build as part of the standard makesystem. </p>

<p>Instead, there is a MS Visual C++ project file and a <a HREF="Makefile">Makefile
for Unix</a>: 

<ul>
  <li>Adjust the Makefile (or project) to point to the correct path names for EPICS base,
    extensions and TCL<br>
    (The project file assumes that you installed tcl/tk in <a href="file:///c:/Progra~1/tcl">c:\Progra~1\tcl</a>.
    Check that you installed the full developement version of tcl/tk, including include and
    library files!)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Try to build the extension. </li>
  <li>Configure atac.tcl to load the extension. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you should succeed with building atac, continue here: <a
