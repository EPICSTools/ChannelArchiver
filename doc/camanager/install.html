    <h2>Tcl/Tk</h2>
    <p>Regardless of the Operating System you want to install CAManager on, a
      Tcl/Tk environment including some extra packages is needed.</p>

    <p>The following is a list of packages and their version numbers used for
      development:</p>

    <pre>
  Tcl       8.3
  Tk        8.3
  Tclx      8.3
  Tkx       8.3
  Iwidgets  4.0.0
  BWidget   1.3.1
  Tktable   2.7
    </pre>

    <p>You find ready-to-go versions of Tcl/Tk with the required packages on
      the "ActiveState Programmer Network"
      (<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Tcl/">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Tcl/</a>).
      Follow the link "ActiveTcl download" to get installable binary versions for
      Linux, Solaris or Windows.</p>

    <p>If ActiveTcl is not available for your platform, or you want to use your
      existing installation of Tcl/Tk, you can install the required packages
      manually. You should find references to the sources on the
      "Tcl Developer Exchange" 
      (<a href="http://tcl.activestate.com/">http://tcl.activestate.com/</a>).</p>

    <h2>ChannelArchiver</h2>

    <p>Make sure the ChannelArchiver is installed on your system and the programs
      can be found in the PATH (calling "ArchiveEngine" on the command line
      must not produce a "command not found"-error). This includes proper
      installation of the Channel Access libraries.</p>

    <h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
    <h2>on Unix-Systems (locally and on remote systems)</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>Change to the CAManager directory</li>

      <li>On the command-line issue the command:
	<p>
	<tt>&gt; make</tt>
	</p>
	This will create a single sh-script <tt>install.sh</tt> containing all the
	necessary files to install CAManager

	This process needs a program called <tt>shar</tt> to appear somewhere in your
	<tt>PATH</tt>. That shouldn't be a problem since <tt>shar</tt> is a basic part of every
	Unix-system.
      </li>

    <li>Either
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Execute the just created <tt>install.sh</tt> locally to install CAManager on
	    the local machine or</li>
	  
	  <li> Copy <tt>install.sh</tt> to any other Unix-machine and execute it there to
	    install CAManager on this machine</li>
	</ol>
	
	If you see a message like "./install.sh[3184]: wish: not found." or
	similar, it seems that the path to the Tcl-interpreter 'wish' does not
	appear in your path environment-variable.
      </li>
    </ol>

<b>Please have the following in mind!</b>
<p>
    If you have no DISPLAY environment-variable set, the installation
    script would fail the checks for necesseray Tk-extensions (see above),
    hence the tests are disabled when running without a proper
    DISPLAY environment-variable.
   </p>

    <h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
    <h2>fallback solution (Unix and Windows, old way)</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>Once having an proper Tcl/Tk installation (or to try your pre-installed or
      manually prepared installation) continue with the next step.</p>

    <h2>On Unix Systems</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Change to the CAManager directory.</p>

      <li><p>On the command-line, issue the command:<br><br>

	  <tt>&gt; wish install.tcl</tt><br><br>

	  where wish should be the Tcl/Tk interpreter matching the requirements
	  mentioned above.</p>

	<p><b>Option:</b><br><br>

	  <tt>&gt; wish install.tcl -i</tt><br><br>

	  will install the CAManager without any GUI
	  continue with step 5. if you choose to install this way.</p>
	  
      <li><p>Check the Installation-directory and the Tcl/Tk interpreters found and
	  modify the settings if necessary.</p>

      <li><p>Click the "Install"-button.</p>
	
      <li><p>Check for errors (if there are some)</p>
    </ol>

    <h2>On Windows Systems</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Open the CAManager directory in the explorer.

      <li>Double-click on "install.tcl"

      <li>Check the Installation-directory and modify the setting if necessary.

      <li>Click the "Install"-button.

      <li>Check for errors (if there are some)
    </ol>


    <hr>
    <h1>RUNNING</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>You should now be able to run "CAManager" immediately, either on the
      command-line or (for Windows) from the "Start" menu.</p>
    
    <p>Refer to the
      <a href="quick-start.html">quick-start-guide</a> and the
      <a href="camanager.html">user manual</a> for further procedures/details.
