  <h1>Web Page Generation</h1>

  Another possible application is the interactive or automated
  generation of dayly reports.<br>
  Images of those plots can then be put on Web pages etc.
  The directory ChannelArchiver/casi/tcl/ExampleFromLEDA
  shows a combination of tcl and perl tools:
  <ul>
  <li>A tcl tool beam.tk is used to create two statistical
      plots, summarizing the beam current, on-time, total charge
      per day. It can be run interactively, as well as with command
      line options.
  <li>Perl scripts are used to call the tcl tool and create
      web pages for the resulting images as well as an index page.
  <li>A shell script is used to call the perl tools once a day.
  </ul>  
  <p>
  This is an example dayly plot:<br>
  
  <img src="current.gif" width="700" height="500" alt="current.gif (13095 bytes)">
  <p>

  <hr WIDTH="40%" ALIGN="LEFT">
