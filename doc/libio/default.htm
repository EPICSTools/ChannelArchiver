  <h1><a name="Main">ChannelArchiver I/O Library</a></h1>
  <h3>Standard C++ library</h3>
  <p>The new (1997) standard C++ library for string, list, map, exception, ... classes is
  used whenever possible to prevent reinvention. For historic reasons there are already some
  similar classes &amp; templates in EPICS base, but those are not used.</p>
  <p>std::string showed a memory leak with RedHat 6.1 (that version of egcs g++, that is).<br>
  Tools/stdString is meant as a replacement. It can be used like std::string but implements
  only what was necessary so far.</p>
  <h3>Namespaces</h3>
  <p>Whenever possible, code it enclosed in a namespace Tools or ChanArch.</p>
