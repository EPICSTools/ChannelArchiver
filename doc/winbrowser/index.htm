  <h1>WinBrowser</h1>
  This tool is a WIN32 Browser for ChannelArchiver data files.<br>
  It provides good performance and features like interactive
  scolling/zooming. 
  But unlike the <a href="../cgiexport/index.htm">CGI Tool</a>
  or the scripting interface <a href="../casi/default.htm">CASI</a>
  it's not portable, so its support is now lower on the list.

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  When started with the &quot;-a &lt;archive name&gt;&quot; option,
  WinBrowser will load the channel list for that archive. Otherwise
  you select an archive with the
  <img src="pickarchivebutton.gif" width="45" height="25">
  button next to the Archive name.<br>
  Now you can select channels from the list and send them to the plot
  window by pressing the
  <img src="showbutton.gif" width="71" height="30">
  button. Initially the date/timerange specified in the
  &quot;From:.. To:..&quot; fields will be loaded. When panning or
  zooming the plot, more samples will be loaded from the archive as
  necessary.<br>
  Finally you can print a hardcopy of the plot window or export the
  data into files (currently in Speadsheet or GNUPlot format)
