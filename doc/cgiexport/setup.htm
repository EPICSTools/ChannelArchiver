  <h1>Channel Archive CGI Setup</h1>
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <h3>Web Server</h3>
  Like any other CGI tool, the CGIExport tool for the Channel Archiver
  is a plug-in for a web server.
  This means you have to have a running web server and you need to
  know how to configure it. In here I can only provide examples on
  how to configure some web servers (Apache web server, MS Internet
  Information Server/MS Personal Web Server).<br>
  If you don't understand the examples or happen to use a different
  server, please consider consulting the manual for your web server
  first.<br>
  For any useful application of this CGI plugin you also have
  to generate web pages. Some knowledge of HTML and CGI is required.

  <h3>Access to the archive: Users, permissions, paths</h3>
  The CGI Tool has to have access to the data files, either directly
  or via NFS, SAMBA, ???.<br>
  Note that the web server runs any CGI program as a low priviliged
  user (e.g. 'nobody' on Unix).
  To verify archive access, switch user to this user and try to
  access the data via e.g. the command-line ArchiveExport tool.
  (On unix: "su" to become root, then "su - nobody" to logon as just
  that).<br>
  A special problem: The 'nobody' user might not have PATH,
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc. configured, so it helps to build the CGIExport
  tool without using shared libraries to simplify matters.

  <h3>GNU Plot</h3>
  For the plotting to work, you need GNU Plot. The path to GNU Plot
  is hard-coded into the CGIExport tool at compile time.

  <h2>Example Setup</h2>
  The default path names are relative but fixed and have to be
  similar to the Test directory tree underneath the CGIExport
  source directory. After you changed the CGIExport
  configuration in &lt;ChannelArchiver&gt;/ArchiverConfig.h,
  the following might no longer work for you:
  <ul>
    <li>ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests/<br>
        HTML files for accessing the CGI Tool, must be exported via
	WWW server.<br>
	When producing any output, CGIExport looks for files
	<em>cgi_body_start.txt</em> and <em>cgi_body_end.txt</em>.<br>
	This Test directory is prepared such that these files contain
	links to additional web pages about the &quot;Rounding&quot;
	feature etc.<br>
	<u>For now that is the &quot;Manual&quot;
	on how to use the CGI tool.</u>
    <li>..../Tests/cgi<br>
        The executable CGI tool must be copied in here as
	<b>CGIExport.cgi</b>.<br>
	Note the file extension, it's used in the WWW server
	configuration later on!<br>
	The WWW server must allow &quot;execute&quot; access to
	this directory.<br>
	(For Win32, the files Com.dll, db.dll and ca.dll
	from your EPICS/base/bin/WIN32 also have to be copied in here.)
    <li>..../Tests/cgi/tmp<br>
        In here, the CGI tool creates temporary files, so you must
        create this directory
  </ul>
  Make sure that the WWW server as well as CGI programs launched by it
  (usually running as &quot;nobody&quot;) have access to those parts
  of the file system, especially check <em>write access</em> to
  ...../cgi/tmp !<br>
  To test the CGI tool, make the Test directory accessible by your WWW
  server and make sure that the cgi subdirectory is executable (see
  below for MS and Apache specifics).<br>
  There are simple Perl scripts cgi/Hi.pl and cgi/env.pl to debug your
  WWW setup. <br>
  You don't need perl to use the CGIExport tool in the end.<br>
  The scripts are meant to test your web server setup because many CGI
  extensions are written in Perl and therefore every web administrator
  should be able to help you with this:<br>
  If installed and configured correctly, you can access
  <a href="http://%3cyour%20host%3e/archive/cgi/Hi.pl">&quot;http://&lt;your
  host&gt;/archive/cgi/Hi.pl&quot;</a>
  to verify that
  <ul>
    <li>Your web server is running at all</li>
    <li>You managed to configure it correctly in order to execute the
        perl-CGI scripts
  </ul>
  The next step is to test if you can execute the CGIExport tool:<br>
  Try &quot;<a href="http://localhost/archive/cgi/CGIExport.cgi">
  http://&lt;your host&gt;/archive/cgi/CGIExport.cgi&quot;</a>.<br>
  You should see some HTML page, no error message.

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  When called with COMMAND=HELP like this:<br>
  <a href="http://localhost/archive/cgi/CGIExport.cgi?COMMAND=HELP">
  http://&lt;your
  host&gt;/archive/cgi/CGIExport.cgi?COMMAND=HELP&quot;</a><br>
  the CGIExport Tool will display the commands and parameters that
  it understands.<br>
  The example web page ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests/Default.htm
  shows some links that call the tool with a specific archive
  directory, channel list, commands etc.<br>
  When your WWW server setup was successful as explained in there,
  you should be able to point your web browser to http://localhost/archive/Default.htm and
  see that initial test page.

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  Ideas on what to test:
  <ul>
    <li>Web Server: Can you access the web pages, e.g. the
        &quot;Default.htm&quot; file?
    <li>Web Server: Can you access the CGI directory, i.e. read it and
        are the files executed as  programs?
    <li>If the perl scripts respond OK but CGIExport.cgi doesn't: Can
        you execute it as &quot;nobody&quot;? Are shared libraries
        missing which happen to be in your path as USER=&lt;you&gt;
        but not when you are USER=&lt;the web
        server=nobody&gt;?
    <li>Can the cgi tool (or the pseudo-user that runs it) access the
        data files?
    <li>Can the cgi tool create the temporary files needed for the
        plots?
    <li>Can ... launch GNU Plot?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Microsoft IIS (Windows 2000)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Install the IIS from the Win2000 disk,
        it shows up under additional products.
	When looking at <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>
	for the first time, you get linked to the documentation.
    <li>Configure under
        "ControlPanel"/"Administrative Tools"/"Computer
        Management":<br>
	Right-click on "Default Web Site", select New Virtual
        Directory. Name it "archive", broswse to
	ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Test, select only "read" for access
	permissions.<br>
	<a href="http://localhost/archive">http://localhost/archive</a>
	should now lead to an archive test page, the links on there
	don't work until the next step is completed.
    <li>Right-click to properties on the "cgi" directory under the
        "archive" virtual entry created in the previous step.
	Uncheck the "read" permission, select "Execute Permissions"
	"scripts and executables", "Application Protection" to "High".
    <li>If you have Perl: Click "Configuration", "Add", set executable
        to e.g. "c:\sys\perl\bin\perl.exe %s".
	This should allow to browse
	<a href="http://localhost/archive/cgi/env.pl">
	http://localhost/archive/cgi/env.pl</a>
	which might help in debugging CGI problems.
    <li>While ".pl" had to be configured, I could not find a ".cgi"
        entry but executasbles ending in .cgi seem to be lauched
	without further configuration when "scripts and executables"
	were selected for the directory.
  </ol>


  <h2>Microsoft Personal Web Server</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Export the Test directory as e.g. &quot;/archive&quot;,
    <li>Export Test/cgi directory as &quot;/archive/cgi&quot; and make
        it executable
    <li>Modify registry to allow perl scripts (useful for debugging,
        not essential for CGI tool):
        <pre>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3Svc\Parameters\Script Map]
          c:\sys\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s;
	</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Apache Web Server</h2>
  Add to end of /etc/httpd/httpd.conf :
  <pre>  #Added for CGIExport Test:
  #
  #Uncomment these (usually found earlier in this file)
  #if you want perl support:
  #LoadModule perl_module modules/libperl.so
  #AddModule mod_perl.c
  #
  #Note that without special settings,
  #apache does not follow symb. links,
  #so these names have to be 'real':
  Alias /archive &quot;/home/Kay/Epics/extensions/src/ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests&quot;
  &lt;Directory /home/Kay/Epics/extensions/src/ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests&gt;
  Order Allow,Deny
  Allow from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
  # Make /archive/cgi executable, allow Perl:
  # (this requires the above settings to activate mod_perl)
  AddHandler perl-script .pl
  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

  &lt;Directory /home/Kay/Epics/extensions/src/ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests/cgi&gt;
  PerlHandler Apache::Registry
  PerlSendHeader On
  Options +ExecCGI
  &lt;/Directory&gt; 
</pre>

  Start/stop on Linux:<br>
  /etc/rc.d/apache {start|stop|status|restart|reload}
  <p>On RedHat6.x:<br>
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd {start|stop|status|restart|reload}
  <p>Error Log:<br>
  cat /var/log/httpd.error_log
  <hr>
