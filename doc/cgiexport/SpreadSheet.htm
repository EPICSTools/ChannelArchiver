  <h1>Exporting into a SpreadSheet</h1>
  <h2>What to do</h2>

  When you press the &quot;GET&quot; button to retrieve a SpreadSheet,
  the archive export software provides you with a text that can be
  saved from within your Web borwser to your local disk.
  <br>
  Usually it's a good idea to save that data to a file named
  &quot;c:\temp\data.xls&quot;, i.e. ending in &quot;.xls&quot;. Then
  you can double-click on the created file, MS Excel will be launched
  and you're ready to process the data.
  The comments preceeding the data itself give some more hints for
  plotting.

  <h2>Internet Explorer 5</h2>
  There is a problem with this specific version of the&nbsp; MS
  Internet Explorer. The following does <em>not</em> apply to Netscape
  or older versions of IE:<br>
  Even if you choose the menu item &quot;File/Save As&quot; and then
  &quot;Save as type=Text File&quot;, the generated text file will
  contain additional leading lines like these:

  <code><p>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;<br>
  &lt;META content=&quot;text/html; charset=windows-1252&quot;
  http-equiv=Content-Type&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br>
  &lt;BODY&gt;&lt;XMP&gt;; Generated from archive data<br>
  ;<br>
  ... </code></p>
  These lines, wrongly added by IE 5, have to be removed with e.g. the
  notepad program before Excel can parse the file.<br>

  Another option: Save as &quot;Text File&quot; <u>AND</u> use
  &quot;txt&quot; for an ending, not &quot;xls&quot;.
