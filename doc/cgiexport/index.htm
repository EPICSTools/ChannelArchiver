  <h1>CGI Export Tool</h1>
  This Tool allows basic access to Channel Archiver Data&nbsp; over
  the web:
  <ul>
    <li>List Channel names, maybe filtered by a regular expression
    <li>Get start/end times for the available data
    <li>Retrieval of data in spreadsheet format
    <li>Simple 2D &amp; 3D plotting.<br>
      This interesting feature is implemented in a highly portable way
      by calling GNUPlot. Hence it is available for Win32, Linux and
      Solaris, maybe more systems.<br>
      Though response times for the examples given below are well
      within 5 seconds for 2D, 10 seconds for 3D, this is not meant to
      be a replacement for an optimized Win32 or Unix tool.<br>
      (More on gnuplot:

  </ul>

  Note that the ArchiveEngine has a built-in web server.
  That one allows you to monitor the ArchiveEngine status
  and configuration, not archived data!
  This different issue is described in the ArchiveEngine
  section of the manual.

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  The compilation and installation is described in the <a
  href="setup.htm">setup section</a>.
  The creation of web pages is described in the HTML specs on
  <a href="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</a> as well as in
  thousands of books.<br>
  From then on, few users had problems with understanding how
  to enter the channel name into the name field and picking the
  start and end times from the start and end time selector boxes
  (see the following screenshots).<br>
  If you follow the example setup, the test web pages should include
  links to the web pages mentioned below under "Usage Details".
  This is helpful in explaining the remaining, less obvious options
  for "fill" etc.

  <h2>Some Examples</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>Channel Info</td>
      <td>Scalar Channel Plot</td>
      <td>Waveform Plot</td>
