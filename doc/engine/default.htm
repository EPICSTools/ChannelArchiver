  <h1>Archive Engine</h1>
  The ArchiveEngine is an EPICS ChannelAccess client. It can save any
  channel served by any ChannelAccess server. The most common ChannelAccess
  servers are EPICS IOCs (Input/Output controllers) running the EPICS
  database.
  <br>
  The ArchiveEngine provides two fundametal modes of archiving:
  Periodically or monitor. With periodic archiving, one sample
  is taken every second (or 5 seconds or 0.1 seconds...).
  In monitor mode, each change is archived up to a configurable
  limit or e.g. 0.1 seconds (faster changes are ignored).
  <br>
  The ArchiveEngine is configured with a text file that lists
  what channels to archive and how. Each given channel
  can have a different periodic scan rate or be archived in monitor
  mode (on change).
  <br>
  One design target was: Archive 10000 values per second,
  be it 1000 channels that change at 10Hz each or 10000 channels
  which change at 1Hz.
  <br>
  The ArchiveEngine saves the full information available via
  ChannelAccess: The value, time stamp and status as well as
  with control information like units, display and alarm limits, ...
  <br>
  The data is written to local disk files.
  Several <a href="../retrieval/default.htm">retrieval tools</a>
  allow you to investigate the archived data.
  <br>
  While running, status and configuration of the ArchiveEngine
  are accessible via a built-in web server.
