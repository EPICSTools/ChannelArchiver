  <h1>ArchiveEngine Web Server</h1>
  The ArchiveEngine has a built-in web server (HTTP server)
  for status and configuration information.
  <ul>
  <li>You can use any web browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer)
      to access this ArchiveEngine web server.
  <li>You can do that on the computer where the ArchiveEngine
      is running as well as from other computers, be it a PC
      or Macintosh or ... as long as you are on the same network.
  <li>You do <b>not</b> need a web server like the Apache
      web server for Unix or the Internet Information Server for Win32
      to use this. The ArchiveEngine itself acts as a web server.
  <li>You <b>cannot</b> view archived data with this mechanism.
      See the documentation on 
      <a href="../overview/default.htm#retrieval">retrieval</a>, especially the
      CGIExport tool for web access to archived data.
  <li>You can not only use this mechanism interactively but also
      write your own HTTP client programs, elegantly based on the
      HTTP client libraries that come with perl or python,
      to explore this web interface.
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <img align=right src="engine.gif" width="459" height="646">
  You have to know the internet name of the machine that is running
  the ArchiveEngine as well as the TCP port.
  If you are on the same machine, use "localhost".
  The port is configured when you start the ArchiveEngine, it defaults
  to 4812. Then use any web browser and point it to<br>
  <code>http://&lt;host where engine is running&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code><br>
  e.g. <a href="http://localhost:4812">http://localhost:4812</a>
  <br>
  The start page of the ArchiveEngine web server should look
  similar to the one shown to the right.
  <br>
  From there on you can hopefully follow the links except for the
  following one:
  
  <h2>Stop the ArchiveEngine</h2>
  To avoid accidental stops of the ArchiveEngine, the link
  to the stop URL is hidden.
  You have to manually type the special URL
  <code>.../stop</code>, e.g.
  <a href="http://localhost:4812/stop">http://localhost:4812/stop</a>
  into your web browser.<br>
  In case your ArchiveEngine has been compiled with password
  protection enabled (has to be done at compile time),
  you will be prompted for a user-name and password.
  That name and password are also picked at compile time.<br>
  In Engine/Tools there is an example tcl script that stops the
  engine with a user name and password in case you want to stop the engine
  from within a script and not interactively.
  <p clear=all>
  <br clear=all>

  <h2>Online Configuration</h2>
  <img align=right src="cfgpage.gif" width="431" height="726">
  If not disabled using the <tt>-nocfg</tt> command line option,
  this page allows you to add new groups and then add channels
  to those groups.
  If you want to change the configuration of a channel,
  you can do so by adding it again with the new configuration.
  Note: This only allows you to "upgrade" a channel to a smaller
  scan period or the "Monitor" mode. You cannot remove channels.

  <A NAME="persist"><h2>Persistent configuration</h2></A>
  When the configuration is changed via the Web interface (channels
  added etc.), the original configuration files are <b>not</b> changed.<br>
  Instead, the engine tries to write a <em>new</em> set of
  configuration files in a "cfg" subdirectory. You will get <em>cannot
  write to cfg directory</em> messages if no such directory exists.
  You can either decide that you are not interested in keeping online
  changes to the configuration or create a cfg subdirectory.
  After a shutdown, a
  system like cvs or edit-and-compare can then be used to merge the
  online changes as reflected by configuration files in the cgf
  subdirectory into the original files. (better ideas welcome)
