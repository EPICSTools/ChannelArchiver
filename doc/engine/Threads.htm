  <h1><a NAME="Main">Threads</a></h1>
  <p>The ArchiveEngine uses two threads: <ol>
    <li>Main thread. </li>
    <li>Write thread. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>On most OSs you will see a single process:</p>
  <p>On Linux, however, one can see three &quot;processes&quot; like this:</p>

  <p>This snapshot taken with ktop shows the parent/child relation. When triting a test
  program with two threads, one can see four &quot;processes&quot;: </p>

  <p>This seems to be a feature of Linux: Threads show up a processes.</p>
  <p>As far as I understand for now this is no error in the Archive Engine. </p>

  <h1>Signals</h1>
  The engine tries to catch the Ctrl-C and Unix 'kill' signals.<br>
  On Win32, this seems to work correctly.<br>
  On Unix there have been problems originally.
  Now that the write thread blocks the signals,
  archive writing should be unaffected
  and the engine quits as soon as possible.<br>
  The preferred method for stopping the engine, though,
  should still be the web interface.
