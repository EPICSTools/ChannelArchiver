  <h1>CASI - Channel Archive Scripting Interface</h1>
  <h2>SWIG-wrapper for LibIO</h2>
  <h2>Compilation</h2>
  <p>This extension is not built as part of the standard make system because it involves too
  many other extensions that are not uniformly configurable as part of the EPICS make
  system. </p>
  <p>Instead, there is a MS &quot;nmake&quot; <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a> for Visual C++
  and a <a href="Makefile.Unix">Makefile.Unix</a> for Unix. <ul>
    <li>First, build the other portions of the ChannelArchiver:<br>
      Tools, LibIO, Engine, ...</li>
    <li>Verify that swig is installed, if necessary get it: <a href="http://www.swig.org">www.swig.org</a>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that you have the tools that you intend to build this extension for: tcl/tk,
      python, ... and know where their include and libraries are.<br>
      (Hint: For RedHat Linux, this means you not only have to have python installed but also
      the &quot;developer&quot; RPM for python) </li>
    <li>Adjust the Makefile that use use to point to the correct path names for EPICS base,
      swig, tcl, python, ... </li>
    <li>Call gnumake or nmake on your makefile, maybe specifying only &quot;tcl&quot; or
      &quot;python&quot; to skip building what you don't need. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>SWIG was used to avoid platform dependencies. This also means that you have to check
  the swig manual first in case of errors. Link errors for building the shared modules are
  the most likely problem, but except for the swig manual and your system docs you're on
  your own with that... </p>
  <h2>Usage with Python</h2>
  <p>You'll need python, of course. I tried Python 1.5 as it comes with Redhat 6.1. It's
  also available for Win32 from <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>.<br>
  In addition, you need:<ul>
    <li>Tk and BLT. Tk might be part of the python that you get initially, BLT is usually not.
      Find it at <a href="http://www.scriptics.com">http://www.scriptics.com</a> or <a
      href="http://www.tcltk.com/blt">http://www.tcltk.com/blt</a>.<br>
      Note that you need a version of tk that works with your version of python. The latest tk
      might be too new.<br>
      Similar: You need to build BLT for the version of tk that python uses.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Pmw, the python meta widget library, also from <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Set PYTHONPATH to include the casi directory (where casi.py and casic.dll/so/??? have
  been created in the compilation step), e.g.<br>
  export PYTHONPATH=/home/kasemir/Epics/extensions/src/ChannelArchiver/casi/python/O.Linux<br>
  That directory also holds a html document about the SWIG-generated syntax for the archive
  access classes.</p>
