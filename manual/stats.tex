\section{Statistics}
It is impossible to provide universal performance numbers for the
components of the ChannelArchiver toolset. Tests of a realistic setup
(IOCs communicate with ArchiveEngines, data client tools query data
from the network data server) are always influenced by network delays.
The CPU seems a little less important, but hard disk performance is:
Access to data that is on NFS-mounted disks is by orders of magnitude
slower than access to data on local disks.

The following are some arbitrary performance values obtained on a computer
with an 800MHz AMD Athlon CPU and a Mylex DAC960PTL1 PCI RAID Controller,
Atlas 10K discs.

\subsection{Write Speed}
As a baseline for raw data writing speed, the 'bench' program that can
be found in the ChannelArchiver/Engine directory consistently writes
around 100000 values per second on that computer.

\subsection{Index}
% LANL Xmtr Data 2002:
Converting old directory files into index files,
1.2MB dir files into 12MB index files: 2 minutes.

Creating a master index for 12 sub-archives,
about 1.4GB of data files: 1min, 40 sec.
Re-run of the ArchiveMegaindex tool where there was
little to do because the sub-archives didn't overlap: 8 secs.

% LANL Xmtr Data 2003:
Same tests for a bigger collection of 92 sub-archives,
converting 12MB dir files into 60MB index files: 5 min, 20 sec.

Creating a master index for the 92 sub-archives,
about 2.3GB of data files: about 40min.
Re-run (nothing to do): ? secs.
