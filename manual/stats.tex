\section{Statistics}
It is impossible to provide universal performance numbers for the
components of the ChannelArchiver toolset. Tests of a realistic setup
are always influenced by network delays: IOCs communicate with ArchiveEngines,
data client tools query data from the network data server.
The CPU speed is less important than hard disk performance:
Access to data on NFS-mounted disks is by orders of magnitude
slower than access to data on local disks.

The following are some arbitrary performance values obtained on a computer
with an 1~GHz CPU and ordinary IDE disk.

\subsection{Write Speed}
As a baseline for raw data writing speed, the 'bench' program that can
be found in the ChannelArchiver/Engine directory consistently writes
at least 80000 values per second on that computer.

\subsection{Index}
% LANL Xmtr Data 2002:
Converting old directory files into index files,
1.2~MB dir files into 12~MB index files: 2~minutes, 20~secs.

Creating a master index for 12 sub-archives,
about 1.4GB of data files: 45~seconds for a master
index of 24~MB.
Re-run of the ArchiveMegaindex tool where there was
little to do because the sub-archives didn't overlap: 4~secs.

% LANL Xmtr Data 2003:
Same tests for a bigger collection of 92 sub-archives,
converting 12MB dir files into 60MB index files: About 12 minutes.

Creating a master index for the 92 sub-archives,
about 2.3GB of data files: about 30~minutes, the resulting
index uses about 1.1~GB.
Re-run (nothing to do): ? secs.
