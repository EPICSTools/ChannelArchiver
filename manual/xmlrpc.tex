\section{XML-RPC}
The following is a description of the calls implemented by the archive
data server based on the XML-RPC protocol.

\subsection{archiver.info}
This call returns version information for 
whoever cares. It will allow future compatibility
if clients check for the correct version numbers.

\begin{lstlisting}[keywordstyle=\sffamily]
{ int32 ver, string desc } = archiver.info()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}
\item[ver:]  Version number. Currently we use ver = 1.
\item[desc:] Cute description that one can print.
\end{description}

The result is a structure with a numeric "ver"
member and a string "desc" member. Implementations
like perl will return a hash with members "ver"
and "desc".
