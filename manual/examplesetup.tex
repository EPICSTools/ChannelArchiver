\chapter{Example Setup} \label{ch:examplesetup}
% ======================================================================
The following describes how the archiver toolset is used at the
\INDEX{Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)}, and how the scripts in
the ChannelArchiver/ExampleSetup directory assist with the
setup as described in here.
We distinguish between two types of computers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sampling Computer:\\
      A computer that runs ArchiveEngine instances.
\item Serving Computer:\\
      A computer that uses the ArchiveIndexTool to create
      additional binary indices and runs the ArchiveDataServer.
\end{itemize}

\noindent There might be more than one 'sampling' computer as well as more
than one 'serving' computer.  A single machine might perform both
functions, but in general they can be different computers on the
network, and hence some tools are required to make the data collected
on the "sampling" computer available on the "server".  One could use
NFS, but we have decided to use secure copy (scp) in order to decouple
the computers as best as possible.

We want to be able to move an engine from one computer to another, and
still keep an overview.  Therefore a file ``/arch/archiveconfig.xml''
describes the complete archive setup: Which engines run where, and how
the data gets served.  On some computers, for example
ics-srv-archive1, further subdirectories of ``/arch'' are used to run
engines.  On another computer, for example ics-srv-web2,
subdirectories contain data copied from archive1 so that the data
server can serve it.

% ======================================================================
\section{Setup, archiveconfig.xml}
% ======================================================================
Each computer needs to have the same copy of /arch/archiveconfig.xml,
and the scripts from the ExampleSetup directory of the archiver
sources need to be copied into /arch/scripts.
You might generate and distribute archiveconfig.xml manually or use a
relational database.  People who have used previous releases of the
archive toolset might remember the archiveconfig.csv file. There is a
tool scripts/convert\_archiveconfig\_to\_xml.pl to convert that file into an
archiveconfig.xml skeleton.

\lstinputlisting[float=htb,keywordstyle=\sffamily,caption={archiveconfig.xml},label=lst:archiveconfig]{../ExampleSetup/archiveconfig.xml}

\noindent The archiveconfig.xml file describes the complete archive layout,
using the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item root: Names the root directory, typically '/arch'.
      This has to be the same directory name on all computers,
      since they all use the same archiveconfig.xml.
\item serverconfig: Location of the server configuration to be
      created. See section \ref{sec:updateServer}.
\item mailbox: Used to communicate from the ArchiveDaemons to
      the data server.
\item daemon: Configures an archive daemon and its engines,
      described in section \ref{sec:daemon},
      as well as how that data should be indexed and served,
      see sections \ref{sec:updateServer} and \ref{sec:updateIndices}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Sampling Computer}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\InsertImage{width=0.9\textwidth}{archiveconfig_sample}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:acSample}Tools used on a sampling computer, refer to text.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Instead of running just one archive engine, it is often preferred to
run several. This way, there can be separate engines for separtate
subsystems, possibly maintained by different people.  In addition,
periodic restarts, for example once a week, create a separate
\INDEX{Sub-Archive} with each restart, thereby limiting the
possibility for data loss in case an engine crashes or creates corrupt archives.

For each subsystem, an ``ArchiveDaemon'' program manages one or more
engines, monitors their condition, and performs the periodic restarts.
For example, we might run one `daemon' for the Integrated Control
System (ICS) and one for the channels related to Radio Frequency (RF).
The ICS daemon should maintain one ArchiveEngine for the timing system
(tim) and one for the machine protection system (mps), while the RF
daemon has one engine for the low-level and one for the high power RF
(llrf, hprf).

This separation is somewhat arbitrary. We could have made ``llrf'' and
``hprf'' channel groups under one and the same engine. In fact all the
above could reside within one engine, and the result would probably be
less CPU load compared to the setup with multiple engines.  It is,
however, advisable to spread the channels over different daemons and
engines whenever different people deal with the IOCs that host the
channels, so that the engineers can independently configure their
archiving.  In addition, you want to keep the amount of data collected
by each engine within certain bounds, for example: not more than one
CD ROM per month, one DVD per year, or whatever you plan to do for
data maintenance. You can of course also follow the approach that most
sites use in reality: Wait until all disks are full, then panic.
In which case, another reason is data safety: You can reduce the
damage caused by crashes of one engine to a certain number of channels
and the data for the restart period, for example one week.

% ======================================================================
\subsection{Configuration}
% ======================================================================
The configuration of the sampling computer is primaririly done
in the $<$daemon$>$ sections of the archiveconfig.xml.
See section \ref{sec:daemon} for more on the daemon.

% ======================================================================
\subsection{update\_archive\_tree.pl}
% ======================================================================
Initially and after every change to the configuration,
the update\_archive\_tree script is used to create the necessary infrastructure.
This script reads archiveconfig.xml and create all the subdirectories,
daemon config files, and skeleton engine configurations which are
meant to run on the local computer.
Run it with ``-h'' to see available options.

\NOTE In order to determine what daemons should run on the
\INDEX{local host},
the \INDEX{host name} in the \INDEX{``run'' tags} is used as a
regular expression for the host name.
So when specifying that a certain daemon should run on ``archive1'':
\begin{lstlisting}[keywordstyle=\sffamily]
 <daemon ...
    <run>archive1</run>
    ...
\end{lstlisting}
... that daemon will run on computers called ``ics-srv-archive1'' as well
as ``archive1.sns.ornl.gov'' etc.
The same applies to the \INDEX{``host'' tags} which specify where a
data server should run.

For the example from listing \ref{lst:archiveconfig}, we would get
these subdirectories:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,keywordstyle=\sffamily]
  RF
  RF/llrf
  RF/llrf/ASCIIConfig
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent Each directory contains configuration files and scripts
explained in the following. Each engine directory also contains an
``ASCIIConfig'' subdirectory with a script ``convert\_example.sh''
that you might use to create the XML configuration file for the
ArchiveEngine from ASCII configuration files, though the engineer
responsible for the subsystem is free to use any method of his/her
choice as long as the result is a configuration file for the engine
that follows the naming convention
\begin{center}
{\it Daemon-Name} / {\it Engine-Name} / {\it Engine-Name}-group.xml~,\\
\end{center}
If you want to use the ASCIIConfig directory, check section
\ref{sec:ASCIIConfig} for the format of the ASCII configuration files.

% ======================================================================
\subsection{ArchiveDaemon} \label{sec:daemon}
% ======================================================================
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\InsertImage{width=0.8\textwidth}{daemon}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:daemon}Archive Daemon, refer to text.}
\end{figure}

\noindent The ArchiveDaemon is a script that automatically starts,
monitors and restarts ArchiveEngines on the local host. It includes a
built-in web server, so by listing all the ArchiveEngines that are
meant to run on a host in the ArchiveDaemon's configuration file, one
can check the status of all these engines on a single web page as
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:daemon}.

The daemon will attempt to start any ArchiveEngine
that it does not find running. In addition, the daemon can
periodically stop and restart ArchiveEngines in order to create
e.g.\ daily sub-archives.  Furthermore, it adds information about
each sub-archive of newly created ArchiveEngines to a mailbox directory
so that the index mechanism can create the necessary indices
and update the data server configuration.

Before using the ArchiveDaemon, one should be familiar
with the configuration of a single ArchiveEngine (sec.\ \ref{sec:engine}),
and how to start and stop it manually.

% ======================================================================
\subsubsection{Configuration}
% ======================================================================
You will typically \emph{not} directly configure an archive daemon,
but instead specify its configuration in the ``archiveconfig.xml''
file. The ``update\_archive\_tree.pl'' script will then generate
those daemon configurations needed for the local computer, and ignore
those meant to run on other machines.

Assume the configuration shown in listing \ref{lst:archiveconfig},
which calls for an ``RF'' daemon to run a ``llrf'' engine on the host
``archive1''. So on ``archive1'', a subdirectory ``/arch/RF'' will be
created with the daemon configuration shown in listing 
\ref{lst:daemonconfigex}, which complies with the DTD from listing
\ref{lst:daemonconfigdtd}.

\lstinputlisting[float=htb,keywordstyle=\sffamily,caption={Example Archive Daemon Configuration},label=lst:daemonconfigex]{../ExampleSetup/ArchiveDaemon.xml}

\noindent The following is an explanation of the daemon-related tags in the
``archiveconfig.xml'' file. Compare with the created daemon
configuration to see how they get translated.

\begin{itemize}
\item run\\
      Both the daemon and each engine have this element, which
      specifies the host name where a daemon and engines should run.
      The names are regular expressions.
      In principle, this setupone would think about the following setup:
\begin{lstlisting}[keywordstyle=\sffamily]
 <daemon directory='RF'>
    <run>archive[12]</run>
    ...
    <engine directory='llrf'> 
       <run>archive1</run>
       ...
    <engine directory='hprf'> 
       <run>archive2</run>
\end{lstlisting}
      ... where RF/llrf runs on ``archive1'' and RF/hprf runs on
      ``archive2'', and consequently both of those machine run an ``RF'' daemon.
      This has not been tested. Typically, a daemon and its engines
      are all on the same computer.

      The generated daemon config file only includes the configuration
      needed for the local computer.  So instead of duplicating
      $<$run$>$localhost$<$/run$>$, it is omitted in the daemon config file.
\item desc\\
      A short description.
\item port\\
      Both the daemon and each engine have this mandatory element, which
      determines the port number of the HTTP server. Section
      \ref{sec:daemonserver} describes the HTTP server of the daemon, while
      section \ref{sec:engineport} explains the engine HTTPD.

      \NOTE The port numbers used by the ArchiveDaemons and all the Archive
      Engines need to be different. You cannot use the same port number more
      than once per computer.
\item mailbox\\
      Directory that the daemon uses to communicate with the data server.
\item engine\\
      Specifies the sub-directory for each engine under a daemon.
\item config\\
      This mandatory element of each engine entry contains the path to the
      configuration file of the respective ArchiveEngine, see section
      \ref{sec:engineconfig}.
\item restart\\
      When provided, it specifies when the daemon should re-start an engine.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item daily\\
         The element must contain a time in the
	 format ``HH:MM'' with 24-hour hours HH and minutes MM. One example
	 would be ``02:00'' for a restart at 2~am each morning.
      \item weekly\\
	 Weekly is similar to daily, but using an element that contains the day
	 of the week (Mo, Tu,  We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su) in addition to the time
	 on that day in 24-hour format, e.g.\ ``We 08:00''. In this example,
	 the daemon will attempt a restart every Wednesday,
         8'o clock in the morning.
      \item timed\\
	 In this case, the element needs to contain a start/duration time pair
	 in the format ``HH:MM/HH:MM''. The first, pre-slash 24-hour time stamp
	 indicates the start time, and the second 24-hour time, trailing the
	 slash, specifies the runtime. The engine will be launched at the
	 requested start time and run for the duration of the runtime. As an
	 example, ``08:00/01:00'' requests that the daemon starts the engine at
	 08:00 and stops it after one hour, probably around 09:00.
      \item hourly\\
         The element must contain a number specifying hours: A value
	 of 2.0 will cause a restart every 2 hours. The hourly restart
	 is quite inefficient and primarily meant for testing.
      \end{itemize}
      \NOTE It is advisable to stagger the restart times of your engines
      such that they don't all restart at the same day and time in order to
      reduce the CPU and network load for the ChannelAccess re-connects.
\item dataserver\\
      Specifies the name of the data server host.
\end{itemize}

% ======================================================================
\subsubsection{Starting, running, stopping daemons and engines}
% ======================================================================
The following scripts, some created by ``update\_archive\_tree.pl'' in
each daemon and engine subdirectory, are used to control the daemons
and engines:
\begin{itemize}
\item scripts/start\_daemons.pl\\
      Starts all daemons meant to run on the local computer.
\item scripts/stop\_daemons.pl
      Stops all daemons. See ``-h'' for available options, which
      includes a method to also stop all engines.
\item daemon-dir/run-daemon.sh\\
      Starts the daemon for this subsystem.
      The daemon will then start all engines which are not already
      found running.
\item daemon-dir/stop-daemon.sh\\
      Stops the daemon for this subsystem.

      \NOTE This does not stop the engines, only the daemon.
      See below for more on engine operation.
\item daemon-dir/view-daemon.sh\\
      Script to run 'lynx' with the URL of the daemon HTTPD.
\item daemon-dir/engine-dir/stop\_engine.sh \\
      Stop the engine.

      \NOTE There is no script to start an individual engine, because the
      daemon will eventually start any engine that's not running.
      So stopping an engine is just another means of triggering a
      restart.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Each engine subdirectory contains
\begin{itemize}
\item ArchiveEngine.log\\
  A log file for the ArchiveEngine running in that directory.
\item archive\_active.lck\\
  Lock file of the ArchiveEngine, exists while an engine is running.
\item YYYY/MM\_DD/index \\
  A subdirectory for index and data files of the sub-archive.  If the
  ArchiveDaemon is configured to perform daily restarts, the format
  uses the year, month and day to build the path name.
\item current\_index \\
  A soft-link to the currently used index.
\end{itemize}

% ======================================================================
\subsubsection{Daemon's Web Pages} \label{sec:daemonserver}
% ======================================================================
You can use any web browser to look at the daemon's web pages,
which look simiar to Fig.~\ref{fig:daemon}.
The URL follows the format
\begin{lstlisting}[keywordstyle=\sffamily]
    http://host:port
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent where ``host'' is the name of the computer where the
ArchiveDaemon is running, and ``Port'' is the TCP port that was
specifiedin the config file.

The main daemon web page lists all the archive engines that this daemon controls
with their status. The first column also contains links to the
individual archive engines. The status shows any of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``N/M channels connected''\\
      This means the ArchiveEngine is running and responding,
      telling us that N out of a total of M channels have connected.
      If not all channels could connect, you might want to follow
      the link to the individual engine to determine what channels are
      missing and why: Is an IOC down on purpose? Is an IOC
      disconnected because of network problems? Does a channel simply
      not exist, i.e.\ the engine's configuration is wrong?
\item ``Not Runnnig''\\
      This means that the respective ArchiveEngine did not respond
      when we queried it, and there is no ``archive\_active.lck'' lock
      file. This combination usually means that the engine is really
      not running (except for the Note below).

      The first step in debugging would be to check the engine's
      directory for a log file. Does it indicate why the engine could
      not start? Then check the daemon's log file. It should list the
      exact command used to start the engine. You can try that
      manually to check why it didn't work.
\item ``Disabled.''\\
      The web interface of the daemon contains a link for each engine
      that disables the engine. This places a file
      ``\INDEX{DISABLED.txt}'' in the engine directory and stops the
      engine.  As you might have guessed, the daemon will not attempt
      to start engines as long as the ``DISABLED'' file is found. This
      is a convenient way for temporarily disabling engines without
      removing them from the daemon's configuration.
\item ``Unknown. Found lock file''\\
      This means that the respective ArchiveEngine did not respond
      when we queried it, but there is an ``archive\_active.lck'' lock
      file. This could have two reasons. It could mean that the engine
      is running but it was temporarily unable to respond to the
      daemon's request. An example would be that the engine is really
      busy writing and dealing with ChannelAccess, so that its web
      server had to wait and the daemon timed out. All should be fine
      again after some time.

      If, on the other hand, the situation persists, it usually means
      that the engine is hung or has crashed, so that it does not
      respond and the lock file was left behind.
      See Crashes on page \pageref{sec:crash}.
\end{itemize}

\NOTE The daemon queries only every once in a while and leave the
engines alone for most of the time.
Especially after startup, all engines will show up as ``Not Running''
in the daemon's web page while in fact most of them are already
running. Then you will see many disconnected channels while the
engines did in fact already connect to all channels. 
If you are impatient, you can click on the links to the individual
engines to get a more up-to-date snapshot of each engine's status.

Instead of using the scripts to stop and ArchiveDaemon, one can
directly access the ``/stop'' URL of the daemon's HTTPD,
e.g. ``http://localhost:4610/stop''.  Similar to the ArchiveEngine's
HTTPD, this URL is not accessible by following links on the HTTPD's
web pages. You will have to type the URL. This is to prevent web
robots or a monkey who is sitting in front of the computer and
clicking on every link from accidentally stopping the daemon.
Finally, the daemon will respond to the URL ``/postal'' by stopping
every ArchiveEngine controlled by the daemon, followed by stopping
itself. ``Postal'' is an abbreviation for ``POstpone STopping the
daemon until ALl engines quit''. It is not at all related to ``going
postal''.

% ======================================================================
\subsubsection{Status Information}
% ======================================================================
The following scripts use the HTTPD of the daemon and engine
as well as generic Unix tools to create some status overviews.
They can be used in ``cron'' jobs to periodically update
web pages or send regular status emails.

\begin{itemize}
\item make\_archive\_infofile.pl \\
      Creates summary of daemon and engine status,
      what is running and what is missing,
      how many channels connected etc.
      See ``-h'' option for details.
\item make\_archive\_web.pl \\
      Similar, but creating a web page.
\item engine\_write\_durations.pl \\
      Summary of engine performance: How many channels, average values
      per seconds.
\item show\_engines.pl \\
      Parses output of ``ps'' command for engine related information.
\item show\_sizes.pl \\
      Parses output of ``du'' for size of sub-archives.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\InsertImage{width=\textwidth}{archcfgstat}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:archcfgstat}Example of the archive status web page
  generated by the make\_archive\_web.pl script.}
\end{figure}

\noindent  Fig.~\ref{fig:archcfgstat} shows one example of that web
page: A tabular display of what engines are running, how many channels are
connected, and more.

% ======================================================================
\section{Sub-Archives}
% ======================================================================
Based on the example configuration used in this chapter,
the daemon will 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start an ArchiveEngine in ``RF/llrf'' that writes to
      a sub-archive named after the current day,
      e.g.\ ``RF/llrf/2004/02\_11/index''.
\item Periodically verify if engines that are supposed to run are
      actually running, attempting to start engines which are found missing.
\item Stop the llrf engine each Wednesday at 10:20, and restart it in
      a new subdirectory, using the date of the restart for the path name to the
      new index file.
\item Generate a file in the mailbox directory with information about
      the ``old'' sub-archive, the one used by the engine that was
      stopped.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent As a result, we create weekly sub-archives for the LLRF,
which provides some insurance against crashes of an
ArchiveEngine. If paranoid, you choose daily sub-archives.
After running for a while, we will have created sub-archives like these:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,keywordstyle=\sffamily]
  RF/llrf/2004/02_11/index
  RF/llrf/2004/02_18/index
  RF/llrf/2004/02_25/index
  ...
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent In addition to each index file, there will of course also be
associated data files, but for retrieval purposes we identify an
archive solely by its index file: We can invoke e.g.\ ArchiveExport
with the path to any of the index files. This is, however,
inconvenient because we will only see data for one week of that one
subsystem at a time.
The ``serving'' computer will therefore use additional index files.

% ======================================================================
\section{Serving Computer}
% ======================================================================
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\InsertImage{width=0.9\textwidth}{archiveconfig_serve}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:acServe}Tools used on a serving computer, refer to text.}
\end{figure}

\noindent The serving computer might actually be the same as the
sampling machine, or it can be a different computer. In any case, all
computers must have access to the same archiveconfig.xml file and
mailbox directory.
The following describes the scenario used at the SNS with 
different computers and no writable NFS share between the
affected machines.

% ======================================================================
\subsection{Configuration}
% ======================================================================
Of primary interest to the serving computer are the $<$dataserver$>$
sections of archiveconfig.xml, which are allowed for each daemon and
engine entry:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,keywordstyle=\sffamily]
   <dataserver>
      <current_index key='4901'>llrf</current_index>
      <index type='binary' key='4902'>LLRF data</index>
      <host>web2</host>
    </dataserver>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item current\_index\\
      This option is only allowed for engine data server entries.
      When provided, the ``current\_index'' link created by the
      archive daemon for this engine will be served by the
      data server as its own key and name.

      This of course requires access to the current\_index from the
      serving computer. At the SNS, we have a read-only NFS mount from
      archive1 onto web2, and ``/arch/RF/llrf/current\_index'' is a
      manually created soft-link to the actual current\_index softlink
      on the NFS share.
\item index \\
      Create an index of given type, ``list'' or ``binary''.
      For an engine, the index covers every data found in the engine
      directory, typically combining the sub-archives from weekly
      restarts into one master\_index.

      For a daemon, the index combines the master\_indices of engines
      under the daemon into one daemon-level master\_index. This
      requires that there are engine indices!

      If a key is proviced, the index is added to the data server
      configuration. It might make sense to only provide a key for the
      daemon-level index, while the engine-level indices are only used
      as an intermediate steps for constructing the daemon index.            
\item host \\
      The host where the data server should run. Entries where
      the host element, used as a regular expression, does not match the
      local hostname, are ignored.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{send\_mailbox.pl}
In the absence of a writable NFS share for the mailbox directory,
this script is run by a cron-job to send the contents of the mailbox
directory to other computers.
For now, this means: It is periodically invoked on ``sampling''
computers to send the current mailbox content to the ``serving''
machine. See command-line help for details.

\subsection{update\_server.pl} \label{sec:updateServer}.
This script should be invoked periodically by a cron-job.
It checks the mailbox directory for information about new data on a
``sampling'' computer. Compares with the archiveconfig.xml information
to decide which of that data should be served on this machine. Uses
secure-copy (scp) to pull new sub-archives onto this computer,
optionally with md5 checksum.  Finally invokes update\_indices.pl.

\subsection{update\_indices.pl} \label{sec:updateIndices}.
Reads archiveconfig.xml and creates an indexconfig.xml for each
engine and daemon directory that has a $<$dataserver$>$ $<$host$>$
entry for the local machine.
Where binary indices are requested, the ArchiveIndexTool is invoked.
Finally, the serverconfig.xml is updated.

% ======================================================================
\section{Common Tasks}
% ======================================================================
\subsection{Modify Engine's Request Files}
Locate your archive engine directory and the engine configuiration
file, for example /arch/RF/llrf/llrf-group.xml for the ``llrf'' engine
maintained by the ``RF'' daemon.
Modify or re-create that configuration. This is often done via a conversion script in
/arch/RF/hprf/ASCIIConfig. If you used another method to create the
engine configuration, this is a good time to remember what you did.

Then, to actually use that new config file, the engine needs to
restart. We could simply wait for the next scheduled restart, in our
example the next Wednesday, 10:20. Alternatively, we can run the
llrf/stop-engine.sh script.
Watch the RF daemon, for example via /arch/RF/view-daemon.sh.
Within a few minutes, it ought to detect that the engine had stopped
and then restart it.

\subsection{Add Engine or Daemon}
Edit archiveconfig.xml to define the new engine under an existing
demon. Or add a line for a new daemon, then add the new engine under
it.  Unless you feel lucky today, use ``xmllint -valid
archiveconfig.xml'' to check if you preserved the basic XML
well-formedness of the document. Invoke make\_archive\_dirs.pl. Per
default, it will re-create all daemon and engine directories, so you
might want to use the ``-s'' option to limit its operation to the new
or modified subsystem.

In case the daemon was already running, it won't learn about the new
engine unless you restart it. So run the ``stop-deamon.sh'' and then
invoke the ``run-daemon.sh'' script in the daemon directory to start
the daemon (which will then start any missing engines).

\subsection{An Engine isn't running}
Check the process list to assert that the engine in question is really not
running (on UNIX, try ``ps -aux''). Look again. If the engine is
actually running but not responding via its HTTPD, remove the process.
Check the log file of the engine, generated in the engine
subdirectory, for any clues. If you are convinced that the engine is
not running, but find an ``archive\_active.lck'' lock file in the
engine directory, remove it. Now the daemon should be able to start
your engine.  

\subsection{I want to stop a Daemon}
Run stop-daemon.sh.

\subsection{A Daemon isn't running}
Run start-daemon.sh in the daemon directory. If the daemon keeps quitting,
check its log file for clues.

\subsection{Re-building a Master Index}
Whenever you add or remove a sub-archive, the indices for that engine
and daemon (indexconfig.xml, maybe also binary master\_index)
become obsolete: They might still list data in a
sub-archive that you removed, or not yet include the new
sub-archive. Another szenario: you suspect that the master index is
broken, because you can retrieve data from the individual sub-archive
but not via the master index. The recipe:
\begin{itemize}
\item Delete the indexconfig.xml and master\_index
\item invoke update\_indices.pl, or wait until update\_server.pl
      does this for you, triggered by a cron job.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Management}
% ======================================================================
The generation of daily sub-archives reduces the amount of data that
might be lost in case an ArchiveEngine crashes and cannot be restarted
by the ArchiveDaemon to one day. In the long run, however, it is
advisable to combine the daily sub-archives into bigger ones, for
example monthly. The smaller number of sub-archives is easier to
handle when it comes to backups. Is also provides slightly better
retrieval times. Depending on your situation, monthly archives might either
be too big to fit on a CD-ROM or ridiculously small, in which case you
should try weekly, bi-weekly, quarterly or other types of sub-archives.

In the following example, we assume that it's February 2004 and we want
to combine daily vacuum sub-archives into one for the month of January 2004:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,keywordstyle=\sffamily]
cd vacuum/2004
mkdir 01_xx
ArchiveDataTool -copy 01_xx/index 01_01/index \
    -e "01/02/2004 02:00:00"
ArchiveDataTool -copy 01_xx/index 01_02/index \
    -s "01/02/2004 02:00:00" -e "01/03/2004 02:00:00"
ArchiveDataTool -copy 01_xx/index 01_03/index \
    -s "01/03/2004 02:00:00" -e "01/04/2004 02:00:00"
...
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent Note that we assume a daily restart at 02:00 and thus we
force the ArchiveDataTool to only copy values from the time range
where we expect the sub-archives to have data. This practice somewhat
helps us to remove samples with wrong time stamps that result from
Channel Access servers with ill-configured clocks.

There is a perl command \INDEX{make\_compress\_script.pl} that aids in the
creation of a shell script for the ArchiveDataTool, but you need to
review it carefully before invokation.
After successfully combining the daily sub-archives a monthly one,
you need move that dayly data out of the way and finally
rebuild indices that use the data.
