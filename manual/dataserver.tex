\chapter{Data Server} \label{sec:dataserver}
The archiver toolset includes a network data server.
By running this data server on a computer that has
physical access to your archived data, be it because the data resides
on a local disk or an NFS-mapped volume, other machines
on the network can get read-access to your data.

\noindent The data server uses XML-RPC to serve the data. This means that
software running on disparate operating systems, running in different
environments can access your data over the Internet. As an example,
your data server might be a Linux machine on a subnet behind a
firewall. After you configure the firewall to pass HTTP requests, any
Linux, Win32, Macintosh computer both inside or outside of the
firewall can access the data from within perl, python or tcl scripts,
programs written in C, C++ or Java, actually pretty much any programming
language. As illustrated in fig.~\ref{fig:dataserver}, the client
program sends its requests to a web server, which forwards it to the
data server. The dataserver accesses the relevant archives --- you
determine which ones are available via a configuration file --- and
returns the data though the web server to the client program.  You can
configure access security via e.g.~ the Apache web server
configuration because the data server is simply a CGI program.
XML-RPC handles the data type conversions. For details on how to use
XML-RPC from your code, refer to section \ref{sec:xmlprotocol} on page
\pageref{sec:xmlprotocol}.

\section{Installation} % ---------------------------------------------
After successful compilation in ChannelArchiver/XMLRPCServer, you will
have a program ``ArchiveDataServer''. You need to copy that binary as
``ArchiveDataServer.cgi'' into your web server's CGI directory and
assert that the web server can execute the ArchiveDataServer.
The ``.cgi'' extension is important, because otherwise your web server
might not recognize your CGI program as such.
What follows is an example setup for the Apache Web Server under Linux:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Check your Apache configuration file, which can often been found
  in ``/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf'', for the location of your cgi-bin
  directory.  In my case, there was already a CGI directory /var/www/cgi-bin.

\item Create a new CGI directory so that we can specifically configure
   it.\\
   Adding the following to the Apache config file worked for me:
\begin{lstlisting}[keywordstyle=\sffamily]
<Directory /var/www/cgi-bin/xmlrpc>
   SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH  /usr/local/lib:...
   SetEnv SERVERCONFIG /var/www/cgi-bin/ \
                   xmlrpc/serverconfig.xml
</Directory>
\end{lstlisting}
  The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH needs to include all the directories that
  contain shared libraries which your ArchiveDataServer.cgi uses.
  In many cases, this means the EPICS base and extensions' lib
  directories as well as the install location of the expat and XML-RPC
  libraries.
  The SERVERCONFIG variable needs to point to your server configuration
   file, more about which next.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Setup}
You need to prepare an XML-formatted configuration file for the
ArchiveDataServer that follows the DTD from listing
\ref{lst:serverconfigdtd}. Note that the ArchiveDataServer might not
verify your configuration file, so you are strongly encouraged to use a
tool like 'xmllint' on Linux to check your configuration against the
DTD. Listing \ref{lst:serverconfigex} shows one example
configuration which lists two archives to be served. Client programs
will internally use the respective 'key' to access them.
