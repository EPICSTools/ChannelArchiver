\section{Java Archive Client}
This tool is meant to be the main data retrieval tool. It provides a
graphical user interface to allow data browing. It is based on Java
and hence usable on many operating systems. It accesses the data via
the DataServer described in section \ref{sec:dataserver}, which means
that it can access the data via the network.

In short, it's the greatest thing since canned beer.
