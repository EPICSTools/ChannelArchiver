  <h1>Export: Time Stamps</h1>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>The EPICS time stamps provide accuracy up to the nanosecond level
  and the  ChannelArchiver saves those stamps without loss. The clocks
  of multiple I/O controllers can be synchronized to a high degree, so
  time stamps remain comparable even if the channels originate from
  different machines. <br>
  A problem arises when you compare different channels. The time
  stamps might differ slightly because a single CPU cannot scan
  several channels exactly at once. In addition, scan tasks on
  different machines are not synchronized, you might also want to
  compare channels that were scanned at different rates or were
  archived on change ('monitored'). <br>
  The net result is that for a given exact point in time the archiver
  will seldom find more than one value. When exporting in a
  spreadsheet format, '#N/A' is used to indicate this:
  <center><table BORDER="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.700986000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.701046000</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:37.400964000</td>
      <td>0.0543581</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:37.510961000</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
      <td>-0.111776</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  In the example, the time stamps of channels A and B are obviously
  &quot;close&quot;, but since they are still different and cannot
  simply be put on a single line in a spreadsheet format.<br>
  You can still plot this data, even with interpolated lines, but
  calculations like &quot;A-B&quot; will always yield '#N/A' for the
  example above since either A or B is undefined.

  <h2>Filling</h2>
  When the &quot;Fill&quot; option is enabled, the previous value of a
  channel will be repeated, filling what used to end up as
  &quot;#N/A&quot; in the original data:

  <center>
  <table BORDER="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.700986000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.701046000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:37.400964000</td>
      <td>0.0543581</td>
      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:37.510961000</td>
      <td>0.0543581</td>
      <td>-0.111776</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:39.410965000</td>
      <td>0.139948</td>
      <td>-0.111776</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  The remaining '#N/A' entries are caused by special conditions,
  e.g. a disconnected channel. An initial undefined value appears
  because the filling mechanism starts only after the channel has a
  valid value.<br>
  To remind you that these time stamps are not the exact ones from the
  archive, a comment is added to the header of the exported data. (A
  similar remark is added for the following, time-stamp-changing
  operations)

  <h2>Linear Interpolation</h2>
  With linear interpolation, time stamps will be chosen with a fixed
  period as specified in the &quot;Interpolate&quot; field. The values
  are then interpolated from the raw values:

  <center>
  <table BORDER="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.700986000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.701046000</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:30.000000000</td>
      <td>0.0692162</td>
      <td>-0.089806</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:32.000000000</td>
      <td>0.065201</td>
      <td>-0.0956562</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:34.000000000</td>
      <td>0.0611858</td>
      <td>-0.101506</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:36.000000000</td>
      <td>0.0571706</td>
      <td>-0.107357</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  Again some undefined values remain initially and whenever special
  conditions don't allow interpolation.
