  <h1>Channel Archive CGI Interface</h1>
  The following examples show some ways of linking to
  the CGIExport tool from a web page.<br>
  
  You should try to understand the HTML text
  and then come up with your own web pages.<br>
  
  The links on this page assume that the web server
  was setup according to the ChannelArchiver/doc/cgiexport/setup.html.

  <h2>CGIExport: Supported CGI parameters</h2>

  To see if the web server is configured correctly to
  execute the CGIExport tool at all,
  try a link like this which will cause the tool
  to display supported parameters:<br>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <A HREF="cgi/CGIExport.cgi?COMMAND=HELP">
   cgi/CGIExport.cgi?COMMAND=HELP</A>
  </P>

  <h2>Take 1</h2>
  This example allows you to start the CGI interface
  for a user-supplied archive file:
  <form METHOD="GET" ACTION="cgi/CGIExport.cgi">
        Archive:
        <input TYPE="TEXT" NAME="DIRECTORY"
	VALUE="../../Engine/Test/index" SIZE="40"
	MAXLENGTH="100">
        <input TYPE="submit" NAME="COMMAND" VALUE="START">
        <input TYPE="submit" NAME="COMMAND" VALUE="DEBUG">
  </form>
  This is probably not what you want for "end user access".
  <BR>
  But it's very useful for testing, especially the DEBUG command:<br>
  CGIExport will dump the parameters and the environment,
  so you can check why e.g. the tool might fail to be able to
  open an archive.
  <br>
  <I>If you feel that the information from the DEBUG command is dangerous
  because it might invite hackers,
  compile the CGITool without debug information.</I>

  <h2>Take 2</h2>
  This example launches the CGI interface with a predefined archive:<BR>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>
	  <A HREF="cgi/CGIExport.cgi?DIRECTORY=..%2F..%2FEngine%2FTest%2Findex&COMMAND=START">
	  Go to Archive</A>
	</P>
  <P>
  This is the usual setup. You might have several archive links on the
  "start" page that launch the CGI tool on different archives.

  <h2>Take 3</h2>
  This example launches the CGI interface with a predefined archive
  and initiates the "LIST" command:<BR>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>
	  <A HREF="cgi/CGIExport.cgi?DIRECTORY=..%2F..%2FEngine%2FTest%2Findex&COMMAND=LIST">
	  List names in "Project XXX" Archive</A>
	</P>
  <P>
  Similar is the next example:

  <h2>Take 4</h2>
  Launch the CGI interface with a predefined archive
  and immediately run the "INFO" command on two predefined channels:<BR>
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>
	  <A HREF="cgi/CGIExport.cgi?DIRECTORY=..%2F..%2FEngine%2FTest%2Findex&COMMAND=INFO&NAMES=fred%0D%0Ajane%0D%0A">
	  Info for fred, jane</A>
	</P>
  <P>
  All the commands that you can access via the form fields and buttons
  on the CGIExport-generated web page
  can be invoced directly as shown in this example.

 <P>
 Note that the appearance of the CGITool output can be adjusted:
 <UL>
 <LI>Put files <I>cgi_body_start.txt</I> and <I>cgi_body_end.txt</I> in this directory.
     They are shown before/after the CGITool's output.
 <LI>Change the source....
 </UL>
