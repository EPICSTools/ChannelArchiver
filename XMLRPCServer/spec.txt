* Spec. for Archiver Server/Client

** archiver.info
Returns version info for whoever cares.

{ int32 ver, string desc } = archiver.info()

The result is a structure with a numeric "ver"
member and a string "desc" member. Implementations
like perl will return a hash with members "ver"
and "desc".

ver:  Version number.  All in here uses ver = 1
desc: Cute description that one can print.

** archiver.get_names
Returns channel names and start/end times.
Pattern is a regular expression.
If left empty, all names are returned.

{string name, int32 start_sec, int32 start_nano,
              int32 end_sec,   int32 end_nano}[] 
            = archiver.get_names(string pattern)

The result is an array of structures, one structure
per channel that matches the pattern.
Start/end gives an idea of the time range that can
be found in the archive for that channel.
The archive might actually contain entries _after_
the reported end time because the index might not
be up too date on the end times.

Time Stamps:
Not(!) the raw EPICS time stamps with 1990 epoch,
but time_t (1970 epoch).

** archiver.get_values
result = archiver.get_values(string name[],
                             int32 start_sec, int32 start_nano,
                             int32 end_sec, int32 end_nano, int32 count,
                             int32 how)

how : 0 - get raw data from archive, starting w/ start,
          up to either 'end' time or max. 'count' samples.

Result := { string name, meta, int32 type, int32 count, values[] }[]

name: The channel name.
      Result[i].name should match name[i] of the get_values() request,
      so this is a waste of electrons, but it's sure convenient
      to have the name in the result, and we're talking XML-RPC,
      so forget about the electrons.

meta := { int32 type;
          type==0: string states[],
          type==1: disp_high, disp_low, alarm_high, alarm_low,
                   warn_high, warn_low, prec, units
        }

type:  string	0
       enum	1 (XML int32)
       int      2
       double   3

count == 1 : scalar, value.value is an array with only one entry
count >  1 : array,  value.value is an array with more than one entry

values := { int32 stat, int32 sevr, int32 secs, int32 nano, <type> value[] }
